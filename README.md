This is a boilerplate for solving many classification based tasks.
Code is written for MNIST database but will enough hyperparameter tuning, it works for other databases as well.
I have included one of good model that I trained using this.



Make sure to download=True if you havent already downloaded the databases
Also I used CUDA for GPU integration. You can use a CPU instead and remove all the hassle of using CUDA.

I have also updated Michael Nielsens original code for Python3 and Numpy2.6 .
